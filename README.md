# Restek eZ Dev Tools Bundle

Restek eZ Dev Tools Bundle is an eZPlatform bundle for developers building sites using the eZPlatform CMS.

**NOTE:** 

1. This tool compliments [ezsystems/launchpad](https://github.com/ezsystems/launchpad). For anyone who prefers to work inside the docker engine container instead of using the `~/ez` commands outside the container.
2. This tool could also compliment [kaliop-uk/ezmigrationbundle](https://github.com/kaliop-uk/ezmigrationbundle) when running migrations that result in errors. Instead of deleting the migration with the kaliop migration delete command, you can use the [database import](docs/USAGE.md#database-development) command to reset the database.
